        <h2>TOM CLANCY'S GHOST RECON : BREAKPOINT</h2>
        <p>Taken at face value, Ghost Recon Breakpoint has been assembled from all the pieces it needs to be a success. And that’s its biggest problem.</p>
		  
        <p>Ubisoft’s entire open-world playbook has been dumped in, alongside many of the games-as-service elements you’d expect to find in a game you’re intended to play for a long time. There are just too many ideas crammed in without a reason to exist and too many annoying bugs and glitches to get a consistent feel for what Breakpoint is aiming to be. It contradicts its good first impression with its reliance on an all-too-familiar shoot-and-loot formula and a collect-a-thon that wears out its welcome before the end.</p>
		  
		  <p>Part of the lack of undeniably fun moments is due to the fact that I feel like I’ve played this game already, several times over. If you’re familiar with Ubisoft’s many open-world series you have an idea of what to expect here: you’ll take color-coded missions running from story-pushing main objectives, non-vital but still involved side quests, faction missions to please the various stakeholders on the island, and a number of collectible missions to find blueprints or upgrade parts. There’s so much of it that the impressively large island-chain setting Auroa looks like someone threw a handful of Skittles at a map and your job is to pick them up one at a time.</p>
		  
		  <p>Having lots of stuff to do isn’t a bad thing under the right circumstances, of course. There’s a ton to accomplish across the gorgeous, varied regions of the archipelago, to the point that you’re never lost for something to occupy your time, even if it’s mostly just busywork. And thanks to a number of overlapping progression systems, you’re constantly rewarded for virtually every action: XP for your character level progress, higher-numbered gear for your Gear Score, faction reputation for your daily/weekly/monthly/seasonal Battle Pass rewards, two different crafting systems (one for gear, one for consumables and gadgets), skill points to climb the branches of your skill tree, and the unlockable collectibles that allow you to buy specific items from the shop or further cosmetically customize your character. It’s endless, for sure, but you’ll never feel like you’re not getting something out of the time you’re spending.</p>

		  <p>There’s some depth added in that many of those progression systems rely on one another. You’ll need your Gear Score at a certain level to undertake the deadlier content in Breakpoint, but in order to get higher-level drops you’ll need to increase your level by doing quests and earning XP. It’s very much a gameplan outline in the games-as-a-service model, and while it reinforces you’re getting stuff done, it feels at odds with the mission statement of a traditional Ghost Recon game. In the opening moments when you’re stranded alone on an island after your chopper goes down and have to dodge patrols of paramilitary thugs, then hide in the trees from the treacherous Col. Cole Walker (played by The Punisher’s Jon Bernthal) and his elite Wolves, I never would’ve expected to spend the next 40 hours managing a deluge of multi-colored, incremental gear upgrades so I could participate in an as-yet-unreleased raid at some point in the future.</p>
		  
		  <p>That feeling of being trapped behind enemy lines is further diluted when you arrive at the player hub – a clandestine mountain-cave home base for the islands’ natives, the homesteaders, the tech-company refugees and all other players in Breakpoint. It’s a neat idea, since so much of Breakpoint is optimized for cooperative play and largely more fun that way, but it shatters any illusion of the one-man-army survivalist being hunted through the wilds of Auroa that Breakpoint is clearly trying to sell.</p>
		  
		  <br><br>
		  <h1 style="font-size: 300%">The tactical stealth elements of Breakpoint are its highpoints, which is a shame, because it's not that.</h1>
		  <br><br>
		  
		  <p>Which is a shame, since the tactical stealth elements of Breakpoint are its highpoints thanks to the mechanics that support it: this is a forgiving stealth system that includes equipping you with thermal and night vision, an enemy-marking drone, and silencers galore, plus allowing you to execute brutal melee kills that border on gross, synced shots to drop enemies in unison, and more. All those pieces are great and help sell the idea of the traditional Ghost Recon tactical stealth game Breakpoint seems to be going for, but they’re ultimately undercut as it falls back on the ubiquitous shoot-and-loot mechanics and cooperative shenanigans of games like The Division 2 as you follow your colored waypoints on a straightforward checklist.</p>
		  
		  <p>The opening hours are also really strong from a gameplay standpoint: the tutorial effectively teaches you the intricacies of the branching skill tree, its straightforward (if not shallow) four-option class system, and the branching, opt-in mission structure. It can be a little overwhelming at first if you’re not familiar with the past few Ghost Recons, since there is an absolute ton of customization, crafting, and upgrade menus to deal with at the same time that the nonlinear mission system lets you effectively choose any type of mission you want from jump street. You can easily spend 20 minutes just figuring out how it all works. And you probably will.</p>
